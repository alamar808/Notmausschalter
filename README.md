A quiz show button that plays random sounds instead of just a *bzzz*

Bill of Materials:
- one Quiz Show Buzzer (e.g. https://www.amazon.de/Out-Blue-60-1147-Kunststoff-Buzzer/dp/B07BWY4XFL/ref=sr_1_8?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=buzzer&qid=1580493530&sr=8-8)
- one Arduino Nano (get it from your favorite nerd store)
- one amplifier module (Alibaba)
- suitable 8 Ohm speaker (i used an old PC speaker from a HP Thinclient with exceptional sound quality)
- one SD-Card extension for Arduino (Alibaba)
- one SD-Card (any old 64MB card or below is more then enough) with PCM coded wav files on in
- one dismantled USB Powerbank (battery + the charger board)
- USB cable to charge the battery
- additional cables, solder, soldering iron
- calm hands and a humble soul
